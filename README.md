# Coderef
FrostHack Hackathon Project
### Project Description
Our Project is a website for Coders(including beginners) to help them find learning, practice and reference of programming and other related websites in an easier manner. It contains a short description and links to some of the popular websites that might be useful for website visitors. It will especially be resourceful for beginners in the world of programming to find websites and YouTube channels that helps them to learn new concepts.

### Tech Stack Used
Our project is a complete frontend website made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

### Social Problem we are working on: 
Dilemma among coders to find suitable websites to learn, practice or refer concepts that might be helpful for them. Here, through our website, we suggest some useful websites’ links, article links and other links to resources that could save the time of coders from searching through long pages of search engine results.

### Various cases of our project and future scope:
Our project can give an idea to coders about the uses or what are the things a popular website offers thereby saving their time to find it out themselves by signing-up to that website. 

In future, this website can give more suggestions of popular websites and could become a popular ‘go to website’ for programmers to find articles and other materials suitable for them. This could save the time of programmers to a great extent and help them become more productive. This website can later include a backend thereby helping signed-in users to get personalized contents curated to their needs, they could also suggest some awesome resources they find to the website authors so that it can be included on the website.

### what we learned
Bootstrap, CSS properties, Time Management, Teamwork, Work Distribution
