                    will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming
                    skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and
                    its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas
                    and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.The intended audience include students
                    for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was
                    not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want
                    to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.</p>
